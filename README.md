# laverna-webclipper

WebExtension to easily import pages into your Laverna instance.

[Click here for a demo](https://benj.me/pub/demo-laverna-webclipper.webm).

You can go on any blog page, click the Laverna icon on the browser bar and it will open an instance of Laverna
and prefill the fields with the contents of the page.

You can also set any URL for the Laverna instance base URL, for example if you self-host one.

Tested under Firefox 51; quality is not assured.

## It doesn't do X

Pull requests accepted :).

I recommend to open an issue to discuss about new features before implementing them.
